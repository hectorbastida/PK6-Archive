# PK6-Archive

This archive includes every fully evolved pokemon and their shiny versions. Builds are taken from smogon, but some of them are altered (probably not for the better). I've used the first smogon build for each pokemon, if there is no build for them on XY, I used BW builds. Since all IVs are 31, I changed Hidden Power for some other attack and that's most likely the only change I made on the builds. They hold the items listed on the builds.

Pokemon which has Mega versions, all has that version included as another pk6 and they have shiny versions as well. And pokemon which has different forms (such as Vivilion) have all of their forms with shiny versions included.
